    "- Revenue and Growth: The Pitcher’s revenue, growth rate, and projections.\n",
    "- Market Potential: The size of the market the startup is targeting.\n",
    "- Profitability: Is the startup already profitable or how close is it?\n",
    "- Uniqueness of the Product: Is the idea innovative? Does it have a competitive edge?\n",
    "- Equity/Valuation: What is the Pitcher asking for in terms of equity and valuation? Will the shark's counteroffer make sense?\n",
    "- Risk Factors: The perceived risks involved (market competition, scalability, etc.).\n",
    "- Pitcher's Personality/Conviction: The Pitcher's passion and conviction can influence how convincing they are."
